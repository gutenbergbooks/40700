  <h3 id="Intro">INTRODUCTORY NOTE.</h3>

  <p>“Dandy Dick” was the third of the farces which Mr. Pinero wrote for the old Court Theatre—a series of plays which, besides giving playgoers a fresh source of laughter, and the English stage a new order of comic play, brought plentiful prosperity to the joint management of Mr. Arthur Cecil and the late Mr. John Clayton. But a kind of melancholy interest attaches to “Dandy Dick,” for this play was, as it were, the swan-song of the old theatre and of the Clayton and Cecil partnership; and it was the piece in which Mr. Clayton was acting when death overtook him, to the general grief.</p>

  <p>The production of “Dandy Dick” may be considered as something of a <i>tour de force</i> in its way. “The Schoolmistress” was at the end of its successful run, and Mr. Pinero was under contract to supply its successor by a certain date, when Mr. Clayton one day went down to Brighton, where the dramatist was then at work, to hear him read the two completed acts of the new play. To Mr. Clayton’s consternation, however, Mr. Pinero announced that he was dissatisfied with his work, and proposed to begin an entirely new play, as he had a more promising<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-6">[Pg 6]</a></span> idea. But time was pressing, and a successor to “The Schoolmistress” was an immediate necessity. However, Mr. Pinero’s idea of writing a play round a dean, who, while being a paragon of dignity and decorum, should be driven by an indiscreet act into a most undignified dilemma, appealed to Mr. Clayton, and hastening back to London with the sketches for the requisite scenes, he left Mr. Pinero to set to work at once upon the new scheme. And within a few weeks, indeed by the time the scenery was ready, the new play was completed, the rural constable of a village adjacent to Brighton having suggested the character of Noah Topping.</p>

  <p>“Dandy Dick” was produced at the Court Theatre on January 27th, 1887, and, meeting with a most favorable initial reception, it settled down immediately into a complete success. The following is a copy of the first-night programme:—</p>

  <p>“Dandy Dick” was performed 171 times between the first night and the 22d of July, when, the old theatre being demolished, Mr. Clayton took a temporary lease of Toole’s Theatre, and transferred the play thither, where it ran 75 nights more.</p>

  <p>A company had already been sent out, under the auspices of the Court management, to perform “Dandy Dick” in the provinces; but, when the play was withdrawn from the London boards, Mr. Clayton set out himself with a company, and it was during this tour that he died at Liverpool.</p>

  <p>In America Mr. Daly produced “Dandy Dick” with Miss Ada Rehan in Mrs. John Wood’s part, but no very great success was achieved; whereas in Australia its reception was so enthusiastic that it<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-9">[Pg 9]</a></span> ran for quite an unusual time both in Melbourne and Sydney. In the character of the Dean, Mr. G. W. Anson achieved perhaps the greatest of his Australian successes, and Mr. Robert Brough made his mark as the policeman.</p>

  <p class="dialogue">Provided always—firstly, that it is Folly that is laughed at and not Virtue; secondly, that it is our friends who laugh at us, [<i>to the audience</i>] as we hope they all will, for our pains.</p>

    <p>This transcription is based on the scan images posted by The Internet Archive at:</p>

    <p class="noindent">In addition, when there was a question about the printed text, another edition posted by The Internet Archive was consulted:</p>

    <p>The following changes were made to the text:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Throughout the text, dashes at the end of lines have been normalized.</li>

      <li>Throughout the text, “and” in the character titles preceding dialogue has been italicized consistently and names in stage directions have been consistently either capitalized (in the text version) or set in small caps (in the html version).</li>

      <li>In the Introductory Note, “St. Marvells” has an apostrophe, whereas in the text of the play it almost always does not. The inconsistency has been allowed to stand in the Introductory Note, but the apostrophe has been removed in the few instances in the text.</li>

      <li>Pg. 25: “<i><span class="name">The Dean</span> gives <span class="name">Darbey</span> a severe look...</i>”—A bracket has been added to the beginning of this line.</li>

      <li>Pg. 91: “<i><span class="name">Sir Tristram,</span> then enters quietly, smoking...</i>”—The comma after “Sir Tristram” has been deleted.</li>

      <li>Pg. 97: “No, Aunt, No!”—The second “No” has been changed to lower case.</li>

      <li>Pg. 139: “Oh, what do you think of it. Mr. Darbey?”—The period after “it” has been changed to a comma.</li>

      <li>Pg. 141: “We can’t shout here, go and cheer...”—The comma has been changed to a semicolon.</li>

      <li>Pg. 142: “That’s Hatcham, I’ll raise his wages.”—The comma has been changed to a semicolon.</li>

      <li>Pg. 143: “’aint” has been changed to “ain’t”.</li>

      <li>Pg. 147: “...mutual esteem, last night...”—The comma has been changed to a semicolon.</li>

      <li>Pg. 154: “I did it?” has been changed to “I did it!”</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The html version of this etext attempts to reproduce the layout of the printed text. However, some concessions have been made, particularly in the handling of stage directions enclosed by brackets on at least one side. (Entrances were usually without brackets.) In general, the stage directions were typeset in the printed text as follows:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Before and within dialogue.</li>

      <li>Flush right, on the same line as the end of dialogue if there was enough space; on the next line, if there was not.</li>

      <li>If the stage directions were two lines, they were indented from the left margin as hanging paragraphs. How much the stage directions were indented varied.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="noindent">In the etext, all stage directions not before or within dialogue are placed on the next line, indented the same amount from the left margin, and coded as hanging paragraphs.</p>
